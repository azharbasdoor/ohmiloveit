This pink crown no longer succumbs to the curse of circumstance,
breaking the thorns of learned helplessness that once bound its branches.

It does not grow from the ground defeated by memories,
but rises because it understands how to love growth.

Its petals dance, its delicate fingers touching every hope,
weaving light into reality with tenderness.

Although the sky often keeps every answer tightly under wraps,
her roots remain calm, enfolding the earth with protection.

For her, seeking her own nectar is an honor,
filling the vessel of life with essence that brings satisfaction.

At twenty-six, she glows beautifully in God's embrace,
flowing His light in every intelligent step she takes.
