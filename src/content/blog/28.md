Hi everyone! Last Eid holiday, I took an unforgettable trip to Bromo Midnight and Tumpak Sewu Malang with my mom. The trip lasted 3 days and 2 nights, starting from Bekasi by bus. The experience was truly amazing, and I can't wait to share it with you all.

<h1> Trekking Through Time: Tumpak Sewu Waterfall in Lumajang </h1>

Where is Tumpak Sewu? FYI, this waterfall isn't actually in Malang. It's actually in Lumajang. The exact location is Jalan Tumpak Sewu, Besukcukit, Sidomulyo, Pronojiwo District, Lumajang Regency, East Java 67374.

That time, my experience visiting Tumpak Sewu with my mom was truly memorable! This waterfall is no joke; the descent is super steep, but it's totally worth it to see it. How long does it take to trek to Tumpak Sewu? First, we had to trek quite hard down for half an hour, or 30 minutes. The path is sometimes slippery and steep, but with the help of an experienced guide, everything becomes safer and you can enjoy the journey.

As soon as we reached the bottom, the sight of Tumpak Sewu waterfall was truly terrifying, so tall and majestic. It truly made us feel small in the midst of nature. We took in every corner, heard the roar of the water, and felt like we'd entered another world.

After our time at Tumpak Sewu, we continued exploring Goa Tetes. We entered the small, dark but exciting cave and saw the unique stalactites and stalagmites. I never imagined I'd have such an experience in the middle of nature.

Then, on our way back, we trekked back to basecamp. Although it was only a short 15 minutes, the route was still challenging yet exciting. I was exhausted but thoroughly satisfied with the day's adventure. Definitely one for the books!

<h1> Yummy Malang Meatballs for Only 10,000 Rupiah </h1>

As my stomach began to grumble at the entrance to Tumpak Sewu Malang, I accidentally stumbled upon a delicious Malang meatball paradise. Amidst the tranquil countryside, this small meatball stall caught my attention with its enticing aroma. For just 10,000 Rupiah, I ordered a plate of meatballs filled with chewy meatballs, yellow noodles, and a rich, flavorful broth. The first bite of meatball was so authentic and satisfying; the broth was warm and the spices were deeply infused. It felt like discovering a culinary treasure trove on the way to this stunning waterfall.

As I savored each bite, I felt a sense of satisfaction that these meatballs not only filled my stomach but also provided an unforgettable culinary experience on my adventure. The stunning natural surroundings of Tumpak Sewu are complemented by the discovery of mouth-watering local cuisine. Visitors to Tumpak Sewu should definitely try these Malang meatballs.

After enjoying Tumpak Sewu, we continued our journey back to Malang to check in at our homestay. I really appreciated the comfort and facilities provided by the homestay, as it provided a good rest before continuing our adventure to Bromo the next day.

<h1> Experience the Bromo Sunrise Trip Malang </h1>

The second day started very early, at 11:00 PM to be exact! We set off for Bromo to catch the famously beautiful sunrise. Our route led to Pananjakan, one of the best spots to watch the sunrise in Bromo. Although the journey was quite long and cold, all the fatigue was worth it when we reached the summit just before the sun began to rise.

<h1> Golden Sunrise Bromo </h1>

On a cold and quiet morning, we began our journey to Mount Bromo by jeep at 1:00 AM. The air around us was calm, with only the rumble of the jeep's engine as it traveled along the rocky road towards our destination.

At 2:30 AM, we arrived at the Sunrise View Point on Kingkong Hill. It was still dark, but we quickly found a comfortable spot to relax for a while while waiting for the sunrise. The cool night air made us even more eager to witness the spectacular view ahead.

At 3:30 a.m., the sky began to lighten slightly. Just as the sun began to rise from behind the mountains, golden hues slowly filled the sky. It was what everyone had been waiting for: the legendary Bromo Golden Sunrise. We couldn't stop gazing at this extraordinary natural beauty.

At 4:30 a.m., after enjoying the beautiful sunrise, we continued our journey by jeep to Puncak View Point to take more photos and further explore the natural beauty of Mount Bromo.

At 6:00 a.m., we arrived at the Bromo Crater area. Here, the distinctive smell of sulfur greeted us. We descended the stairs to the crater, renowned for its magnificence. Trails of white smoke rose from the crater, creating a dramatic scene.

<h1> Whispering Sands of Mount Bromo </h1>

The golden sunrise at Bromo is truly spectacular. The sky gradated from dark to clear, with the majestic Bromo in the background, a truly unforgettable sight. After enjoying the sunrise, we continued our adventure by jeep to explore the Bromo crater and the surrounding area.

The jeep journey took us to Whispering Sands, where I felt like I was in the middle of a vast and beautiful desert.

As we stepped into the sea of ​​sand, it felt like entering another world. The soft white sand flowed between us, accompanied by a gentle breeze that ruffled our hair.

Most impressive was when we heard about the "whispering sand" phenomenon. Hearing local stories about how the sand makes a hissing or whistling sound when you step on it, we were excited to try it ourselves. We walked slowly, enjoying the soft touch of the sand against our feet, while listening intently.

It turned out to be true! Every step we took on the sand was greeted with a soft, heart-rumbling sound. The sound was like a natural song we can only hear in special places like this. Mom smiled broadly at the amazement on my face, and we both enjoyed the moment with bliss.

However, we also realized that this beauty came with a price. The fine dust from the flying sand made us have to be extra careful to protect our breathing. But it was all worth it for this unforgettable experience.

<h1> Teletubbies Hill and Savanna </h1>

After exploring the stunning whispering sands of Mount Bromo, we continued our adventure to Teletubbies Hill and the famous savanna in Malang. Although affected by fires some time ago, the natural beauty here remains captivating.

Teletubbies Hill, located in the highlands around Bromo, offers a celestial-like view, with small hills blending with the vast blue sky. As the sun began to rise in the eastern horizon, the colors of nature changed into more intense and enchanting shades.

We enjoyed a spectacular sunrise moment from here, where the first rays of sunlight embraced the enchanting green hills.

The savanna around Bromo is no less amazing. Even though it looks barren, this vast grassland offers dramatic and beautiful views. We witnessed endless blue skies, surrounded by iconic volcanoes, and the wild life that survives in these harsh natural conditions.

The natural beauty that can still be enjoyed at Bromo Malang is proof of how powerful nature is in showing its miracles. Even though challenges such as fire have struck, this nature still offers an unforgettable charm for its visitors.

This holiday is not only about gathering awe-inspiring visual experiences, but also feeling close to the forces of nature that inspire and refresh the soul. Every corner of Bromo holds an extraordinary story, and I am grateful to have been able to experience it all with Mom.
